NBPS Digital ID:
This is a digital ID application designed to work with Skyward through manual HTTP authentification.
Please take into consideration that we didn't understand what are statics at the point of writing the program.
(Terribly written) Source code is located in /nbb folder. This is an example of what happens when you don't understand completely the point of OOP.
